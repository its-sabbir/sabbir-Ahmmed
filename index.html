        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>Entering the world of software development is about more than just writing syntax; it is about learning a new
            way to think and solve problems. As I begin my first practice, I am embracing the challenge of turning logic
            into functional tools. Every error message is an opportunity to learn, and every line of code is a step
            toward building something meaningful. My goal is to remain curious, stay consistent, and transition from
            someone who uses technology to someone who creates it. This journey starts with a single 'Hello World,' but
            the possibilities are endless.</p>
